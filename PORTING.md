# Fallout 4 1.11.221 port

This branch is based on upstream NAF commit
`9d8efbfea0e2f6048a59f7a7af8ccf814dd61791` and targets Fallout 4
1.11.221 with F4SE 0.7.8. It is not yet runtime-ready.

## Dependency baseline

The upstream gitlinks establish these historical revisions:

- Deweh/CommonLibF4: `425588497bc4c176047bd6c77626be18c26da345`
- Deweh/ik: `b1700d9ad080c82143e2fb83e2594604bee1b9bb`
- zeux/pugixml: `6909df2478f7eb092e8e5b5cda097616b2595cc6`

The supplied Deweh/CommonLibF4 and ik archives match their expected commits
after normalizing archive/git line endings. The supplied pugixml archive is a
newer snapshot and is not used. The checked-out historical pugixml gitlink is
retained.

## CommonLibF4 strategy

The port pins alandtse/CommonLibF4 commit
`ba22620e455dffaf1d7021c16b0728dc28f1ddae`. This is a maintained continuation
of the original library that provides explicit legacy/NG relocation IDs and
runtime-selected layouts. The build is restricted to `ENABLE_FALLOUT_NG`.

The PANDA snapshot retains single-ID compatibility in many places. NAF's 47
distinct legacy IDs are all absent from the supplied 1.11.221 Address Library,
so that model cannot resolve NAF as written. Deweh/CommonLibF4-NG contains useful
NG relocation/layout work and is closely related to the maintained continuation,
but its head stopped in 2025, still declares 1.10.984 as latest, and does not map
NAF's custom relocation set. It is evidence, not the selected dependency.

## Compatibility evidence levels

- **Mechanically translated**: an authoritative old/NG ID pair exists and both
  IDs resolve in their respective Address Library databases.
- **Statically verified**: source declarations and the relevant F4SE/CommonLib
  ABI or layout agree, without claiming runtime behavior.
- **Verified by disassembly**: the exact instruction/function in the supplied
  1.11.221 binary has been inspected and matched semantically.
- **Requires runtime testing**: static evidence is sufficient to build, but game
  behavior still has to be exercised.
- **Unresolved**: evidence is insufficient; no value is guessed.

## Current audit

| Area | Status | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F4SE plugin discovery | Statically verified | F4SE 0.7.8 rejects DLLs without `F4SEPlugin_Version`; the port exports explicit 1.11.221 metadata. |
| CommonLib runtime selection | Statically verified | NG-only CMake configuration; 1.11.221 version constant added from F4SE 0.7.8 source. |
| NAF relocation IDs | Unresolved except noted mappings | All 47 legacy IDs are absent from the 1.11.221 database. Each requires an authoritative NG pair. |
| `EvaluatePackage` ID 1395257 | Mechanically translated | CommonLib records NG ID 2229805; source use has not yet been converted pending full hook audit. |
| Interior hook offsets | Unresolved | IDs 317245+0xBA, 3139+0x158, 338354+0x1E, and 1385889+0xA8 cannot be carried forward. Their legacy IDs do not exist in the NG namespace. |
| Vtables / RTTI | Unresolved | NAF custom types and all `stl::emplace_vtable` uses require NG ID/layout review. |
| Engine structure layouts | Unresolved | NAF's custom RE/Havok structures require field-by-field comparison and runtime tests. |
| Virtual calls | Unresolved | Slots and object layouts require NG validation. |
| LooksMenu integration | Unresolved | Old DLL-relative offsets must be matched against supplied f4ee.dll 1.7.0.3. |

The audit helper is maintained at `../tools/audit_runtime.py` in the project
workspace. A successful compile is not a runtime compatibility claim.
